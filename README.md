# FunASR Demo Repository

This repository contains various demo scripts showcasing FunASR (Fundamental Audio Speech Recognition) capabilities for audio processing and speech recognition tasks.

## Environment Setup

This project uses a dedicated Python virtual environment named `voiceProcess`. 

### Activating the Environment

```bash
source /Users/william/Work/FunASR/funasr/bin/activate
```

When activated, you'll see `(voiceProcess)` in your terminal prompt.

### Environment Details

- **Python Version**: 3.9.6
- **Location**: `/Users/william/Work/VoiceData/voiceProcess`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **ACTIVE** (voiceProcess environment is currently activated)
- **Key Packages**: 
  - pydub (0.25.1)
  - SpeechRecognition (3.10.0)
  - requests (2.32.4)
  - certifi (2025.6.15)
  - pip (25.1.1)

### Installing FunASR

The FunASR library is required for the main functionality but is not currently installed in the environment. Install it with:

```bash
pip install funasr
```

## Current Status

- **Environment**: ‚úÖ voiceProcess virtual environment activated
- **FunASR**: ‚ùå Not installed (required for main functionality)
- **Project Management**: üìã TODO.md created for task tracking
- **Audio Data Path**: `/Users/william/Work/VoiceData/data`
- **Output Path**: `/Users/william/Work/VoiceData/data/text`
